# dungeons-prisoner

A player becomes a prisoner and has to fight against 4 different guardians to escape from the dungeon. The game has 5 scenarios, and the player has a small backpack that carries some tools and weapons that could help them to escape from the prison. At each scenario the player will be given the chance to choose any of the tools from the backpack, but only one tool will be able to help them. Using the wrong tool will make the player continue to be a prisoner or defeated.
